          <h2>The Short Version</h2>
          <h4>I didn't even think you had a problem. What was going on?</h4>
          <p>
              I didn't "have a problem" in the sense you see on TV adds for recovery
            programs. I stopped before I got to that point.
          </p>
          <p>
              I had been drinking "socially" for years. In classic "how to boil a
            frog" fasion my consumption gradually increased in frequency and
            volume. By the week of July 15th, 2015, I was drinking the equivalent of
            about a liter of wine a day. What I drank through the day or from one
            day to the next varied across all types and qualities, but it was always
            a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
              I had had quite a few arguments with Raine in which we disagreed about
            the details of shared experiences. While the notion of Raine being wrong
            about such simple things was inconceivable, I dismissed these
            disagreements as differences in interpretation and such. I made excuses.
          </p>
          <p>
              I had also made excuses for my work performance which held up well in my
            mind and the only negative feedback I had received was balanced by
            counter-feedback from my manager.
          </p>
          <p>
              Socially, all my friendships seemed to be going swimingly. My best
            friend had been upset with me once, but we talked about it later and I
            thought everything was fine.
          </p>
          <h4>Fine, so what happened?</h4>
          <p>
              That afternoon I met a representative for a product we use at work. I
            arranged the meeting so I could talk about some ideas about how they
            could improve their product for us. I arranged for us to meet at my
            favorite bar because it was convenient for both of us and hanging out at
            the bar had become a daily event for me by then.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, I got the time wrong. I was early by an hour. I didn't realize
            this until after I had ordered a pitcher of cider and three glasses. But
            I figured this was the opposite of a problem. I spent the time going
            through work email and brainstorming about work projects. By the time
            the rep showed up I had drunk a third of the pitcher.
          </p>
          <p>  But as a long-time heavy drinker, I wasn't really very drunk in the
            <usual>sense. That came later. We talked about his company's product and</usual>
            <what>sorts of changes I was interested in, and then he started talking</what>
            <about>work they had been doing and how it could benefit us.</about>
