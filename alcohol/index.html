          <h1>From July 16th, 2015 to March 15th 2016, Robert de Forest was a non-drinker.</h1>
          <p>
            Events transpired which brought into stark contrast the differences between
            my model of reality and others'. After a particularly dark incident I made
            the decision to terminate my relationship with alcoholic beverages.
          </p>

          <h2>Why the past tense?</h2>
          <p>
            The rest of 2015 did not improve. Not long after the new year
            started I realized quitting had done little of what I had hoped it
            would. I lost a litle weight and spent less money, but my thinking
            didn't clear and my relationship with work had not improved. I
            also learned that my relationships with my best friend and my wife
            had not deteriorated significantly when I stopped, they were
            just concerned for me.
            
            I identified that work and psych med changes had been far greater
            contributors to my frustrations than alcohol had. I decided then
            that I would start drinking again, but only after I had put
            measures in place to better protect me from those aspects of
            drinking which I still feared.
          </p>

          <h2>And what measures are those?</h2>
          <p>
            I will only drink so long as I can ensure I continue to evaluate
            my drinking against my requirements. My current (March 2016) plan
            is to write a tweet-sized note in Trello for every three drinks or
            "drink equivalent" portions I consume. The note should describe
            either what about the drink or circumstances I am enjoying.
          </p>

          <h2>So you have some way of ensuring that now?</h2>
          <p>
            Not exactly. I am working on 
            <a href="http://github.com/rdeforest/RightOnTime">a tool</a>
            which I will use to remind me to take notes while I'm "partying".
            Eventually the tool will be smart enough to notice when I've taken
            a note and only remind me if I haven't taken one in over an hour.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the tool is not yet done.
          </p>

          <h2>So .. something happened?</h2>

          <p>
            On March 14th, 2016 I had a minor accident on my motorcycle (I'm fine).
            I had little more than bruising, but it the pain was rather
            annoying on the 15th. That night I decided that since I had a
            plan, and since the next day was my birthday that as long as I
            remembered to take notes I wasn't cheating and I could split a
            bottle of wine with Raine while watching Poirot on Netflix, and I
            did.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was devine.
