                That's right. I did not so as much sip an alcoholic beverage before I
              was 21. My first drink was half of a Bartles and James wine cooler. My
              girlfriend at the time was 18 and she was eager to try things that
              older people take for granted. We went to a grocery store and got a
              four pack of wine coolers, then we rented some porn ("Wet Nurses").

                My family has a history of alcoholism and my parents had quit when I
              was 2. I was told that my mother had a hard time not drinking while
              she was carrying me and that my dad brought beer into the hospital so
              she could drink as soon as she was done with my delivery. They had
              given me the impression that alcohol was fun but not worth the risks
