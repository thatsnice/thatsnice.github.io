            <h2>The Short Version</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> My drinking escalated gradually over the course of about 20 years.</li>
              <li>
                 On the night of 2015-07-15 all three spheres of my life seemed to be 
                threatened by things I had said or done under the influence.
              </li>
              <li>
                 At about 2am I was starting to have intense anxiety and was thinking 
                about suicide.
              </li>
              <li>
                 In 2+ years of therapy I had learned to monitor my thoughts and when
                I noticed myself thinking these things I checked myself in to the
                ER.
              </li>
              <li>
                 I was at the hospital for 3 hours, most of which was a conversation
                with a social worker. I developed a more realistic assessment of my
                lifestyle and its impact on the things I care about. I understood my
                options. 
              </li>
              <li> I spent the first half of Thursday mulling and brooding.</li>
              <li>
                 I decided to quit drinking. Details of this decisions appear under
                &nbsp;<a href="the-decision.html">How I Decided To Stop</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                 I talked with Raine about what had happened Wednesday and she helped
                me work on a detox plan based on drinking carefully metered and
                decreasing amounts of alcohol over the course of five days to
                minimize the risks associated with quitting suddenly.
                &nbsp;<em>See the HAMS article <a href="http://www.hamsnetwork.org/taper/">How To Taper Off Alcohol</a>if you're interested in the process.</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                 Friday I met with my psychiatrist. She prescribed me lorazepam to
                use for the detox process in lieu of alcohol. This simplified the
                process dramatically because lorazepam lasts for 3-4 hours and has
                no intoxicating effect in the doses she prescribed.
              </li>
              <li>
                 I had my last dose of lorazepam the next Monday. As of this writing
                that was three days ago and I feel fine.
